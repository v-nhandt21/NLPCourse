0	it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .  
0	though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .  
1	the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert .  
0	a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .  
1	beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .  
1	aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better .  
0	a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .  
1	stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection .  
1	not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort .  
1	all in all , brown sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that's both charming and well acted . it will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face .  
1	nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .  
0	you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .  
0	what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip .  
1	ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar .  
1	the urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative .  
1	it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .  
1	devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower .  
1	whereas oliver stone's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity .  
0	this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer .  
1	if you want to see a train wreck that you can't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .  
0	even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage .  
0	this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .  
0	this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .  
1	a very funny movie .  
1	leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time .  
1	the lady and the duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the french revolution from the aristocrats' perspective .  
0	a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia 
0	the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . "  
1	leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago .  
0	 . . . a rather bland affair .  
1	wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse .  
1	it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look .  
0	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood .  
1	the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true .  
0	a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . ' 
0	more of a career curio than a major work .  
0	the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .  
0	statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british .  
0	distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .  
0	has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " .  
1	wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin .  
1	with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller 
0	if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler .  
1	certainly the performances are worthwhile .  
1	engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .  
1	it's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original .  
1	the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport .  
0	we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so !  
0	a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks .  
0	i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down .  
0	narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess .  
0	must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .  
1	it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun .  
1	one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight .  
1	a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear .  
1	what a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is .  
1	a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy .  
0	such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .  
0	passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .  
1	 . . . a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet .  
0	the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .  
1	in xxx , diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep .  
1	a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film .  
0	about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men .  
0	i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings .  
0	arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .  
0	friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans .  
1	may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .  
0	it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman .  
0	one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .  
0	the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .  
0	 . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .  
0	lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones .  
0	the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder .  
1	beautifully produced .  
0	the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .  
0	it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .  
0	bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad .  
1	 . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games .  
1	not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .  
1	if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it .  
1	a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview .  
0	unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .  
0	this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .  
0	i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .  
1	resourceful and ingenious entertainment .  
1	even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this !  
1	all in all , a great party .  
1	a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears .  
0	manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .  
1	there's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .  
1	about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come .  
1	sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too .  
1	skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor .  
0	a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .  
0	during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' .  
1	stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a " true story " and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies .  
0	as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .  
1	the special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the oscar-winning sound and james horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system .  
0	the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .  
1	defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it . but darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats .  
0	the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . .  
1	it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .  
1	despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .  
0	what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .

1	a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth .  
1	[reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch .  
0	it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .  
1	[hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo .  
1	dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . "  
1	[fincher's] camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller .  
1	davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as amy .  
0	enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .  
0	do you say " hi " to your lover when you wake up in the morning ?  
0	a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .  
0	thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired .  
0	the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .  
0	indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .  
1	a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story .

1	while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor .

1	a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world .  
0	michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .  
1	by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic .  
0	has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .  
0	flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .  
1	despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .  
0	it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " .  
0	a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films .  
1	it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count .  
1	it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .  
1	this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer .  
1	reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .  
1	by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing .  
0	it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .  
0	a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .  
1	the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one .

1	although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs .  
1	the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film . not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher .

1	a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters .  
0	this thing works on no level whatsoever for me .  
1	george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind .  
0	[johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .  
0	too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets .  
0	apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other .  
1	it is definitely worth seeing .  
1	like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive .  
1	the movie's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman's barking-mad taylor to thewlis's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell's hard-eyed gangster .  
1	desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro .  
0	been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional .  
0	given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much .  
1	while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth .  
0	much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .

1	this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .  
1	a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man .  
1	it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .

0	for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie .  
1	like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen's astringent wit .  
0	utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .

1	even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good .  
0	there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .  
1	it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth .  
0	care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .  
1	[scherfig] has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll .  
1	real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros .  
0	no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either .  
1	the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds .

0	stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .  
1	polished , well-structured film .  
0	the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover .  
1	this is a superior horror flick .  
1	the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati .  
0	there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .  
1	for the most part , the film does hold up pretty well .  
1	it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .  
1	the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .  
0	no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas .  
1	unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises .  
0	this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times .  
0	a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .  
0	the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .

1	idiotic and ugly .  
0	the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .  
0	the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot .

1	presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .  
0	the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .  
1	while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system .  
1	a thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy .  
0	the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .  
1	the film oozes craft .  
0	starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .  
0	la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido .  
0	first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .  
0	 . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .  
0	bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not .  
0	i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief .  
1	it's jagger's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite .  
0	 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .  
0	though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .  
0	and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> .  
1	campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful .  
0	the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .  
1	full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing .  
0	with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .  
0	a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .  
0	a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .

0	no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .  
0	despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .  
1	its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .  
1	it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .  
1	though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance .  
1	obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor .  
0	really dumb but occasionally really funny .  
0	even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .

1	a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun .  
1	you'll end up moved .  
0	i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .  
0	benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .  
0	though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .  
1	the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly .  
1	measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller .

0	the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

1	a very capable nailbiter .  
1	whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time .  
1	brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .

0	a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes .  
1	on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .

0	dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?
