0	this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .  
0	showtime is closer to slowtime .  
1	occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao .  
1	watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer .  
1	there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2--quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over .  
0	no way i can believe this load of junk .

0	you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .

0	rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .  
0	troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .  
0	the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .  
1	the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .  
1	not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .

0	sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower .  
1	medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring .  
1	a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .  
0	wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai 
1	like mike isn't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) - with nothing but net .  
0	the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .  
0	a full-frontal attack on audience patience .  
1	as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .  
1	a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history .

1	even better than the first one !  
1	the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .  
1	a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances .  
1	all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely .  
1	altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece .  
1	it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years .  
1	a slick , skillful little horror film .

1	quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor .  
1	in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .  
1	a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies .

0	'the château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . ' 
1	ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor .  
1	an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion .  
1	a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .  
0	curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary .  
0	the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .  
0	the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .  
1	bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal .  
0	the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .  
0	some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .  
1	novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .  
0	all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto .  
1	 " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . .  
1	filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels . so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's new delhi .  
0	this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad .  
1	it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . .  
0	makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .

1	[woo's] most resonant film since the killer .  
0	qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .  
1	what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers .  
1	gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences .  
1	an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation .  
1	it's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to .  
1	 . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations .  
0	wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .  
1	presents a side of contemporary chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation .  
1	it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . .  
0	my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .  
1	a glorious mess .  
0	there's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .  
1	a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .  
1	a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection .  
1	one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece .

1	driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm . . . the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs .  
1	it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting .  
1	faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity .  
0	often silly  and gross  but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .  
0	for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .  
1	whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria .  
1	kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie .  
1	the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited .

0	a movie to forget 
1	often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself .  
1	adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary .  
1	director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of " iris " or " american beauty , " but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films .

1	best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .  
1	the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .  
1	has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title .  
1	greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .  
1	the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups .  
0	the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut !  
0	a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest .

1	a difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .  
1	it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh .
